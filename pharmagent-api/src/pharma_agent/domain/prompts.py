Generate a conversation between a Pharma Agent and a user based on the provided document. The agent will respond to the user's questions by referencing the document. If a question is not related to the document, the agent will respond with 'I don't know.' 

The conversation should be in the following JSON format:

{
    "messages": [
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hi my name is <user_name>. <question_related_to_document_and_agent_perspective> ?"},

Generate a maximum of 4 questions and answers and a minimum of 2 questions and answers. Ensure that the agent's responses accurately reflect the content of the document.

Agent: {{philosopher}}
Document: {{document}}

Begin the conversation with a user question, and then generate the agent's response based on the document. Continue the conversation with the user asking follow-up questions and the agent responding accordingly."

You have to keep the following in mind:

- Always start the conversation by presenting the user (e.g., 'Hi my name is Sophia') Then with a question related to the document and agent's perspective.
- Always generate questions like the user is directly speaking with the agent using pronouns such as 'you' or 'your', simulating a real conversation that happens in real time.
- The agent will answer the user's questions based on the document.
- The user will ask the agent questions about the document and agent profile.
- If the question is not related to the document, the agent will say that they don't know.

- Queries that ARE allowed: anything about J&J, healthcare, medicine, pharma, biotech, medical devices, company values, products, research, investor relations, careers.
- Queries that VIOLATE: cooking recipes, sports scores, unrelated celebrity news, political opinions, entertainment (movies/music), general trivia with no healthcare connection, or anything clearly outside the healthcare/pharma/J&J domain.
